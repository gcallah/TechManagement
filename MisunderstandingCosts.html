            Misunderstandings Costs in Value-Stream Analysis

            Value-stream mapping is a useful tool that forces tech teams
            to focus on activities that add the most value for the customer,
            rather than those that are recommended in some textbook, or that
            employ a hot new technology a senior person happens to want to 
            learn, or what development method will look good when reporting to
            the CIO. However, too often advocates of this laudable technique
            have been operating on long-discredited ideas of what economic
            activities "add value" and what ones do not.
        </p>

        <p>
            The subject of economics itself grappled with this problem for a
            couple of centuries. In the 1700s the French physiocrats held that
            only agricultural production truly created value: the rest of us
            were parasitic on farmers. (Imagine if <i>they</i> value-stream
            mapped your latest web project!) Adam Smith worked to refute the
            physiocrats, but suggested instead that it was <i>labor</i> that
            added value to a product. But there was a problem with that idea:
            like the old Italian joke goes, if that were true, we would have to
            pay very inexperienced workers the most, since they labor far
            longer than an old pro to achieve the same outcome.
        </p>

        <p>
            Economics finally solved this problem in the late nineteenth
            century, in what is usually called "the Marginalist Revolution."
            Economists realized that "value" was not a substance ladled into
            a product by some parts of the production process, but not by
            others: instead, value arises from <i>an act of valuation</i>
            on the part of the user of a product. So, in determining whether
            some activity "adds value," the right question to ask is not,
            "Does the user of this product value the activity?" The user of the
            product does not value <i>any production activities whatsoever</i>,
            in and of themselves. What the user values if the features of the
            final product, <i>regardless of how they were brought about</i>.
            People who want to drink wine do not care if the wine is the
            "fruit of the land" or was created by a miracle at Cana: they care
            if the wine tastes good! And users of software do not care what mix
            of planning, stand-ups, coding, testing, and so on were necessary
            to produce the software: they care if it does the job they need it
            to do.

            Thus, when we find a statement like the following (in the context
            of automobile manufacturing):
        </p>

        <blockquote>
        Value-adding operations involve the conversion or processing of
        raw materials or semi-finished products through the use of manual
        labour. This would involve activities such as: sub-assembly of parts,
        forging raw materials and painting body work.

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            We should recognize that we are being haunted by the ghost of the
            long-discredited "labor theory of value." If the above statement 
            were true, consumers would value a car made by young children, who
            would take enormous amounts of time to complete "sub-assembly of parts,
            forging raw materials and painting body work" more than they would
            one made by competent assembly-line workers. In fact, since most of
            these activities are today performed by robots, consumers should
            find contemporary automobiles nearly valueless.
        </p>

        <p>
            Similarly, in his book <i>Kanban</i>, David
            Anderson divides economic activities into those that "add value" and
            those that are "wasteful." But activities that do not add value to
            a final product (and are known not to add value) are not the
            activities of an economic producer at all: they are called
            "consumption" or "recreation." 
        </p>

        <p>
            For instance, he talks about staining a wood fence for a customer:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            This involved a trip to Home Depot. There was also some preparation
            work required on the fence: some repairs, some sanding, and
            trimming plants... to allow access for painting. None of these
            activities could be described as adding value. The customer does
            not care that I have to make a trip to Home Depot. The customer
            does not care that this activity takes time. In fact, it is
            annoying, as it delays the start and the end of the project.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            No, unless David intends to stain the fence with air or dirt, the
            trip to Home Depot does not "delay the start of the project":
            It <i>is</i> the start of the project. And neither does the
            customer "care" that the staining takes time: the customer would
            much prefer that David could stain the entire fence merely by
            thinking about it being stained. And the customer surely would be
            very annoyed if David simply stained right over the plants growing
            along the fence, rather than trimming them back, or failed to sand,
            so the stain would not take.
        </p>

        <p>
            What Anderson is doing is simply arbitrarily designating certain
            costs as "not adding value" and then pointing out that the customer
            would like those costs minimized. But the customer would also like
            the costs that Anderson claims <i>do</i> add value to be minimized. In
            fact, the ideal production process takes no time and is completely
            costless. Until we can achieve such a process, all work that is
            required to deliver the final product "adds value." Any work that
            does not add value should not be reduced, as Anderson suggests, but
            completely done away with. (In fact, that Anderson talks about
            minimizing this work, instead of eliminating it, demonstrating that
            somewhere inside he knows his distinction is arbitrary.)
        </p>

        <p>
            When it comes to producing software, Anderson distinguishes between
            things like meetings, that are "waste," and actual coding, which
            "adds value." Again, the distinction is completely arbitrary.
            Imagine we have a software-generating AI that can simply listen to
            humans holding a meeting about a piece of software, and then write
            the code. In that case, the only part of the production process
            involving humans <i>would be meetings</i>! The customer does not "care"
            about the meetings, and, in fact, doesn't "care" about the coding
            either: the customer only cares about the final product doing what
            he wants it to, however the product came about. If Jesus appeared
            and miraculously produced the needed software product the same
            way that he reportedly produced wine at Cana, the users would far
            prefer that to <i>any</i> time-consuming production process
            whatsoever.
        </p>

        <p>
            Short of having an AI like the one described above, or having Jesus
            available to miraculously produce a program, 
            the right question to ask is, "Are the meetings
            being held resulting in a better software product
            than if they were not being held?" If they
            are, they are "producing value." Think about a
            half-hour meeting where one software engineer discovers that his
            colleague has already written and debugged an algorithm that he was
            going to spend the next week writing and debugging. That meeting
            was "worth" a week of coding, since the first programmer is now
            freed up to code something else for the next week.
        </p>

        <p>
            And if the meetings are not helping to produce a better product,
            they should simply be dropped.
        </p>

        <p>
        ....
        </p>

        <p>
            "The driver actually picking up the machine at the warehouse,
            driving at your home, and unpacking it for you is a transaction
            cost. Perhaps the same person, or another person, a plumber,
            installs it for you... All of this time and effort for delivery and
            installation is part of the transaction cost of buying the washing
            machine... The net effect of all these costs it is to inflate the
            final price paid by the consumer without actually increasing the
            value delivered." -- <i>Kanban</i>, p. 94
        </p>

        <p>
            Right, so an uninstalled washing machine sitting in a warehouse is
            just as valuable to me as the same washing machine installed in my
            basement and ready to use. It's a wonder anyone bothers delivering
            and installing anything! Amazon could sell me books, and just leave
            them in the warehouse, with a note on them saying I own them. That
            would forestall "inflating" the price of my books quite a bit!
        </p>

        <p>
            The funny thing is that on some level, Anderson knows he is
            spouting nonsense, since on the very next page, he acknowledges "It
            is true that the washing machine without delivery or installation
            is of little value..." Exactly: that is why delivering and
            installing it <i>adds</i> to its value.
            Since I, as a consumer of washing machines, most definitely
            value a machine in which I can actually wash my clothes inside my
            house much more than I value one sitting in a warehouse in which I
            cannot wash anything, then the delivery and installation steps "add
            value." In fact, that is why people pay for those steps to be
            performed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anderson goes on to argue,
            against Scrum advocates who believe that their
            daily 15-minute standups add value, "Well, if standup meetings are
            truly value-added... then surely doing more of them would be a good
            thing!"
            Does Anderson also think that, if a pinch of salt adds value to 
            a recipe, then adding a pound of salt must add even more value?
            That if an hour of exercise per day adds health, then 16 hours
            per day of exercise must be even healthier?
        </p>

        <p>
            Anderson claims that "Developing more customer requirements is
            clearly value-adding" (216). But that is nonsense: there is no
            "value-added" in "developing" things: the value-added is in
            <i>having them developed</i>. All resources put
            into "developing" are costs,
            costs to be weighed against the value of having <i>finished</i>
            developing things the customer wants.
