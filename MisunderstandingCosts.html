            The following are notes I've jotted down while reading
            David Anderson's book <i>Kanban</i> -- I would of course
            refer to more than just that book in the final article:
        </p>

        <p>
            Anderson divides economic activities into those that "add value" and
            those that are "wasteful." But activities that do not add value to
            a final product (and are known not to add value) are not the
            activities of an economic producer at all: they are called
            "consumption" or "recreation." (The whole idea of "adding value" in
            production is itself questionable, but let's not go into that.)
        </p>

        <p>
            For instance, he talks about staining a wood fence for a customer:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            This involved a trip to Home Depot. There was also some preparation
            work required on the fence: some repairs, some sanding, and
            trimming plants... To allow access for painting. None of these
            activities could be described as adding value. The customer does
            not care that I have to make a trip to Home Depot. The customer
            does not care that this activity takes time. In fact, it is
            annoying, as it delays the start and the end of the project.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            No, unless David intends to stain the fence with air or dirt, the
            trip to Home Depot does not "delay the start of the project":
            It <i>is</i> the start of the project. And neither does the
            customer "care" that the staining takes time: the customer would
            much prefer that David could stain the entire fence merely by
            thinking about it being stained. And the customer surely would be
            very annoyed if David simply stained right over the plants growing
            along the fence, rather than trimming them back, or failed to sand,
            so the stain would not take.
        </p>

        <p>
            What Anderson is doing is simply arbitrarily designating certain
            costs as "not adding value" and then pointing out that the customer
            would like those costs minimized. But the customer would also like
            the costs that Anderson claims do add value to be minimized. In
            fact, the ideal production process takes no time and is completely
            costless. Until we can achieve such a process, all work that is
            required to deliver the final product "adds value." Any work that
            does not add value should not be reduced, as Anderson suggests, but
            completely done away with. (In fact, that Anderson talks about
            minimizing this work, instead of eliminating it, demonstrating that
            somewhere inside he knows his distinction is arbitrary.)
        </p>

        <p>
            When it comes to producing software, Anderson distinguishes between
            things like meetings, that are "waste," and actual coding, which
            "adds value." Again, the distinction is completely arbitrary.
            Imagine we have a software-generating AI that can simply listen to
            humans holding a meeting about a piece of software, and then write
            the code. In that case, the only part of the production process
            involving humans would be meetings! The customer does not "care"
            about the meetings, but, in fact, doesn't "care" about the coding
            either: the customer only cares about the final product doing what
            he wants it to, however the product came about.
        </p>

        <p>
            Short of having such an AI, the question is, "Are the meetings
            being held helpful to producing a better software product?" If they
            are, they are "producing value." (Again, this is not really an
            accurate way to speak: production processes do not ladle out little
            dollops of value here and there into a product.) Think about a
            half-hour meeting where one software engineer discovers that his
            colleague has already written and debugged an algorithm that he was
            going to spend the next week writing and debugging. That meeting
            was "worth" a week of coding, since the first programmer is now
            freed up to code something else for the next week.
        </p>

        <p>
            And if the meetings are not helping to produce a better product,
            they should simply be dropped.

            "The driver actually picking up the machine at the warehouse,
            driving at your home, and unpacking it for you is a transaction
            cost. Perhaps the same person, or another person, a plumber,
            installs it for you... All of this time and effort for delivery and
            installation is part of the transaction cost of buying the washing
            machine... The net effect of all these costs it is to inflate the
            final price paid by the consumer without actually increasing the
            value delivered." -- Kanban, p. 94
        </p>

        <p>
            Right, so an uninstalled washing machine sitting in a warehouse is
            just as valuable to me as the same washing machine installed in my
            basement and ready to use. It's a wonder anyone bothers delivering
            and installing anything! Amazon could sell me books, and just leave
            them in the warehouse, with a note on them saying I own them. That
            would forestall "inflating" the price of my books quite a bit!
        </p>

        <p>
            The funny thing is that on some level, Anderson knows he is
            spouting nonsense, since on the very next page, he acknowledges "It
            is true that the washing machine without delivery or installation
            is of little value..." Exactly: that is why delivering and
            installing it <i>adds</i> to its value.
        </p>

        <p>
            I suspect that what is confusing Anderson is his notion that
            certain parts of the manufacturing process "add value," while
            others don't. But that is looking at things as though the Marginal
            Revolution of the late 1800s had never occurred. There is no
            substance called "value" that is ladled into products as they are
            manufactured. Instead, the materials being worked upon are
            transformed at each stage of the production process, and those
            transformations either result in the consumer of the product
            valuing it more highly, or they do not. If they do, then speaking
            loosely, we could say that they "add value." If they do not, then
            they simply should not be performed.
        </p>

        <p>
            And since I, as a consumer of washing machines, most definitely
            value a machine in which I can actually wash my clothes inside my
            house much more than I value one sitting in a warehouse in which I
            cannot wash anything, then the delivery and installation steps "add
            value." In fact, that is why people pay for those steps to be
            performed.
        </p>

        <p>
        ....
        </p>

        <p>
            Anderson argues, against Scrum advocates who believe that their
            daily 15-minute standups add value, "Well, if standup meetings are
            truly value-added... then surely doing more of them would be a good
            thing!"
            Does Anderson also think that, if a pinch of salt adds value to 
            a recipe, then adding a pound of salt must add even more value?
            That if an hour of exercise per day adds health, then 16 hours
            per day of exercise must be even healthier?
        </p>

        <p>
            Anderson claims that "Developing more customer requirements is
            clearly value-adding" (216). But that is nonsense: there is no
            "value-added" in "developing" things: the value-added is in having
            them developed. All resources put into "developing" are costs,
            costs to be weighed against the value of having <i>finished</i>
            developing things the customer wants.
