            Producing and Reproducing the Culture of Open Source
        </h1>


        <h2>
            Introduction
        </h2>

        <p>
            One of today's most remarkable "knowledge commons" 
            is open-source software (OSS).  GitHub is a service that hosts code
            repositories for software projects, and currently hosts over 100
            million projects, the vast majority of which are open source.  Out
            of the ten most popular
            programming languages, four of them are open-source (Ratan, 2016;
            Putano, 2017).  The producers of those languages coordinate their
            efforts to improve their language using <i>git</i>, an open-source
            product for coordinating and merging the work of multiple people on
            a common project. When the people constructing these tools want to
            create a new version, they typically turn to an open-source tool
            like <i>make</i>, which automates building software products.
            These languages and tools are often used on a <i>Linux</i>
            platform, an open-source operating system.  And where is the
            authoratative source code for Linux stored? On git, which was in
            fact created as a way to manage Linux development. And the most
            popular version of a very popular open-source language like Python
            is built in <i>C</i>, but what's more that C code is often compiled
            using <i>gcc</i>, another open-source software product.
        </p>

        <p>
            The interdependency of these projects means that
            the world of open-source software is a complex
            capital structure (Lachmann, 1978), in which their are multiple
            dependencies among the multitude of open-source projects.
            As Kelty puts it, open-source "communities" are
            "concerned with the ability to build, control, modify, and maintain
            the infrastructure that allows them to come into being in the first
            place" (2008, p. 7). They are "not simply a technical pursuit but
            also the creation of a 'public'" (2008, p. 7).
        </p>

        <p>
            This paper aims to explore how the cultural artifacts
            supporting the development of open source capital goods
            are produced and reproduced by the open source movement,
            and how they provide essential support to the generation
            of capital goods by the open source community.
            In particular, it will examine <i>why</i> anyone contributes to
            open-source software at all, given that any individual programmer
            and any organization using software can always "free-ride" on the
            efforts of anyone who does decide to contribute to an open-source
            project. From Hardin (1968) on, social theorists have recognized
            the temptation to over-use and under-maintain any common resource
            as an important problem. Regarding our topic, over-use is not an
            issue: no one can exhaust the supply of open-source software.
            But why should anyone at all work on its provisioning? Of course,
            on rare occasions, the builders of some open-source software are 
            able to become wealthy as a result, but the vast majority of the
            contributors to open-source projects are working full-time jobs to
            pay their bills and working on open-source projects in their spare
            time. Even an open-source superstar like Guido van Rossum, the
            creator of the Python programming language, has had to work
            full-time jobs at Google and Dropbox to support himself
            (Wikipedia contributors, 2019).
        </p>

        <h2>
            Some Theory
        </h2>

        <p>
            Ostrom (2015, 46-49) divides the problems facing self-organizing 
            governance of commons into "appropriation" and "provision"
            difficulties. Appropriation problems involve how to regulate taking
            resources out of the commons, while provisioning problems are about
            how to invest in maintaining and enhancing the common resource pool. 
            An important aspect of open-source software is that there are
            <i>only</i> provisioning problems: anyone can "appropriate" as many
            copies of some open-source software as they would like, and there
            are still an infinite number of copies left to download. 
            (This aspect of the problem has been recognized by, say Schweik and
            English, 2007.)
            So the focus of this paper will be on "Why does anyone contribute
            at all?"
        </p>

        <p>
            Ostrom admits that the rational-choice framework has some
            difficulties in dealing with self-organizing to ameliorate
            collective action problems: "As Bates (1988)
            points out, the presence of collective benefits
            as a result of designing new institutions is itself
            a second-order dilemma" (2015). Open-source software has been as
            wildly successful as it has because of a set of rules and norms
            that have arisen around the creation, maintenance, and use of OSS.

        <h2>
            A Brief History of Open-Source Software
        </h2>

        <p>
            The movement to create free and open source software had
            ideological roots: the chief early proponent of free source
            software was Richard Stallman, who famously said, “Free software is
            a political movement; open source is a development model.”
        </p>

        <p>
                The notion of "open-source software" arose in the
                1990s as a more ideologically neutral term compared
                to "free software.” This paper does not wish to enter
                into the debate as to what term is most appropriate
                for what are commonly today called "open-source"
                projects, but instead to look at the extent to which
                the concrete capital goods produced by the
                open-source community depend upon cultural aspects of
                open source.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although Stallman and his allies had some success in
            creating free software, most notably the set of GNU
            programming tools, 15 years after the movement began (in
            1983), the vast majority of software in use was still proprietary.
        </p>

        <p>
            But the migration of software from desktops and closed
            networks onto the Internet slowly began to change that.
            The standard “web stack“ in the early 2000's consisted of
            Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Python or PHP: every component
            being a piece of open source software.

        </p>

        <p>
            But of even more importance to the startling success of
            open source software since that time has been the spread
            of the culture surrounding it: a culture of sharing
            source code and knowledge freely among programmers. The
            robustness of this culture has manifested itself in
            several ways. For one thing, there are entire, large
            technical artifacts devoted to sharing information, such
            as Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, and Git Hub. For another,
            large, for-profit software companies increasingly find
            that to recruit and retain good software engineers, they
            must allow those engineers to contribute to open source
            projects. Furthermore, in many cases, the companies
            themselves have wound up turning what were proprietary,
            internal projects into open source projects, as they find
            having the open source community maintain the software
            they use to be more efficient than maintaining it
            themselves, even if this allows competitors to freely use
            the software so developed.

        <h2>
            Cutting the Gordian Knot
        </h2>

        <p>
            Is there a way out of the dilemma presented to us by the existence
            of vast amounts of open-source software in a world of
            self-interested, "rational" agents? I suggest that indeed there
            is: if one's framework suggests some phenomenon cannot exist, and
            yet it persists in existing, then it is the framework that is
            wrong. And in this case, the framework is methodological
            individualism (MI).
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider the following passage from Ostrom (2015, 95):
        </p>

        <blockquote> 
            As Elster (1989, p. 41) states, "punishment almost invariably is
            costly to the punisher, while the benefits from punishment are
            diffusely distributed over the members." Given the evidence that
            individuals monitor, than the relative costs and benefits must have
            a different configuration than that posited in prior work. Either
            the costs of monitoring are lower or the benefits to an individual
            or higher, or both.
        </blockquote> 

        <p>
            Ostrom overlooks the fact that there is a quite different
            answer to the puzzle of why monitoring occurs: it is 
            possible that humans actually <i>enjoy</i> enforcing norms of
            fairness, having a natural propensity to do so, and they suffer at
            the idea that unpunished transgressions of such norms are
            occurring.
        </p>

        <p>
            That overlooked possibility might be regarded as a mere theoretical
            diversion, except that there is empirical evidence that supports
            it, as well as alternate anthropologies to MI that would lead us to
            expect such a situation to hold. For instance, Brosnan and de Waal
            found that "Monkeys refused to participate [in an exercise] if they
            witnessed a conspecific obtain a more attractive reward for equal
            effort, an effect amplified if the partner received such a reward
            without any effort at all. These reactions support an early
            evolutionary origin of inequity aversion." (2003, p. 297)
            Note that from the point of view of most "rational choice"
            theories, this behavior is "irrational," since the monkees, by
            rejecting an unfair reward, instead received no reward: as the
            researchers put it, "subjects forfeited a directly accessible food
            that they readily accept and consume under almost any other set of
            circumstances" (2003, p. 298).
        </p>

        <p>
            Another experimental result, often regarded as an anamoly (or even
            a monstrosity!) by rational choice theorists, is that individuals
            will quite often reject unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game,
            despite the "irrationality" of such a rejection, since they
            therefore receive no payoff, instead of the payoff that was
            perceived as unfair. (See, for instance, Henrich et al. 2004)
        </p>

        <p>
            On the theoretical level, classical anthropology was clearly not
            methodologically individualist. When Aristotle (1992) declared that
            "man is a political animal," he was claiming that human individuals
            are dependent on the prior existence of a social order that can
            sustain them. Or, as Paul put it in 1 Corinthians 12:
        </p>

        <blockquote> 
            Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts
            form one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all baptized
            by one Spirit so as to form one body -- whether Jews or Gentiles,
            slave or free -- and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. 
            Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.

            Now if the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not
            belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part
            of the body. And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an
            eye, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason
            stop being part of the body.
        </blockquote> 

        <p>
            Or consider Herodotus's (1949) analysis of the Persian Wars as
            stemming from a long history of conflict between Greek
            <i>civilization</i> and Persian <i>civilization</i>: individuals
            certainly have their parts to play in his story, but the major
            actors are these historical collectives.
        </p>

        <p>
            So what justifies MI's rejection of the reality of social wholes
            that we find throughout classical anthropology?
            MI's claims to truth certainly are not empirically verifiable:
            "Germany invaded Poland in 1939" and "In 1939 very many Germans
            decided to rush across the border and shoot at Polish soldiers" are
            not descriptions of two different sets of facts, so that we could
            see which facts really occurred and decide between the two
            statements that way. No, the two statements
            are two different ways of describing the <i>same</i> set of facts.
            Methodological individualists often attempt to resolve this
            incomensurability by claiming, "only individuals act" or
            "only individuals choose" (see, for instance, Boettke 2007, Gibson
            2012, Boaz 2017, Gordon 2009, or Mises 2006), without
            argumentation, as though this were <i>self-evidently</i>, or
            perhaps <i>a priori</i> true.  But as Pierre Manent notes, this
            assertion actually blinds the asserters to what is decisive in
            world affairs:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "As I've said, our political regime and our way of life invite us
            to reduce all spiritual masses to the individuals that constitute
            them. Finally, however, however much we may desire to see
            everywhere only rights-bearing subjects and individuals seeking
            their own interests, we run into a number of great collective facts
            that are decisive for world affairs." (2016, 40)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Furthermore, as Alasdair MacIntyre demonstrates, the notion that
            individuals <i>qua</i> are the locus of decision-making and
            practical reasoning is a distinctively modern idea, that far from
            appearing as <i>a priori</i> true to thinkers of earlier times,
            would have appeared patently false:
        </p>

        <blockquote> 
            My thesis is not that the procedures of the public realm of liberal
            individualism were cause and the psychology of the liberal
            individual effect nor vice versa. What I am claiming is that each
            required the other and that in coming together they defined a new
            social and cultural artifact, "the individual." In Aristotelian
            practical reasoning it is the individual <i>qua</i> citizen who
            reasons; in Thomistic practical reasoning it is the individual
            <i>qua</i> inquirer into his or her good and the good of his or her
            community; in Humean practical reasoning it is the individual
            <i>qua</i> property on property participant in a society of a
            particular kind of mutuality and reciprocity; but in the practical
            reasoning of liberal modernity it is the individual <i>qua</i>
            individual who reasons. (2014, 338)
        </blockquote> 

        <p>
            Of course, any theory, including MI, can be maintained in the face
            of any amount of supposedly contrary evidence, so long as one is
            willing to alter auxilliary parts of the theory, or of companion
            theories, to fit the new evidence. This was first noted in the work
            of Pierre Duhem (1991), and later re-inforced by the considerations
            of W.V.O. Quine (1951). Or, as David Lewis put it, "The theory survives
            its refutation -- at a price" (2004, p. ix). But if we
            acknowledging the empirical findings and philosophical
            considerations cited above, it seems clear to me that the price to
            pay for maintaining a commitment to MI is too high: as Hodgson
            (2007) notes, once we acknowledge the importance of social
            relations in all plausible MI explanations, it is hard to see why
            we should retain the one-sided emphasis on "individualism"
            in such explanations.
        </p>

        <p>
            One reason some might want to cling to MI despite the high price to
            be paid for doing so is the idea that the only alternative to MI is
            "methodological holism." But that is just wrong, as, for
            instance, Caldwell (1988) points out. The methodological pluralism
            Caldwell advocates is common in "hard" sciences such as physics,
            where explanations may be in terms of elementary particles, or
            molecules, or collections of molecules, such as gases, liquids, and
            solids, and in biology, where "genes" in classical genetics
            turn out to be an irreducible to the concepts of molecular genetics
            (see Kitcher, 1984).
        </p>

        <p>
            Once we recognize that humans are inherently social beings, the
            puzzle of the existence of successful collective action in the face
            of "collective action problems" dissolves: humans evolved as
            social, group-oriented creatures, and it is simply natural for
            human beings to try to resolve conflicts through group-wide
            agreements. Whether this reality is understood naturalistically 
            (is it a "puzzle" that the cells cooperate to produce a body?)
            or spiritually (see Paul, 1 Corinthians 12), once this perspective,
            argued by philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, and
            Aquinas, and confirmed by modern ethology in its study of primates,
            the puzzle instead becomes why are the cases where humans are
            <i>not</i> able to successfully manage a commons together?

        <p>
            So why do programmers contribute?
            <br />
            Raymond (XXXX?): "it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their
            expertise by writing open-source code and facilitating access to
            information and to computing resources wherever possible."
            <br />
            Tozzi (2017, p. 44): "Unix programmers... collaborated across
            continents and shared code with one another freely, despite
            economic incentives against working in such a way."
