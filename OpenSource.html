            Introduction
        </h2>

        <p>
            One of today's most remarkable "knowledge commons" 
            is open source software. Out of the ten most popular programming
            languages, four of them are open source (Ratan, 2016; Putano, 2017).
            The producers of those languages coordinate their efforts to
            improve their language using <i>git</i>, an open-source product
            for coordinating and merging the work of multiple people on a
            common project. When the people constructing these tools want to
            create a new version, they typically turn to an open-source tool
            like <i>make</i>, which automates building software products.
            These languages and tools are often used on a <i>Linux</i>
            platform, an open-source operating system.
            And where is the authoratative source code for Linux
            stored? On git, which was in fact created as a way to manage Linux
            development. And the most popular version of a very popular
            open-source language like Python is built in <i>C</i>, but that C
            code is often compiled using <i>gcc</i>, another open-source
            software product.
        </p>

        <p>
            In other words, the world of open-source software is a complex
            capital structure (Lachmann, 1978), in which their are multiple
            dependencies among the multitude of open-source projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            This paper aims to explore how the cultural artifacts
            supporting the development of open source capital goods
            are produced and reproduced by the open source movement,
            and how they provide essential support to the generation
            of capital goods by the open source community.

        <h2>
            A Brief History of Open Source Software
        </h2>

        <p>
            The movement to create free and open source software had
            ideological roots: the chief early proponent of free source
            software was Richard Stallman, who famously said, “Free software is
            a political movement; open source is a development model.”
        </p>

        <p>
                The notion of "open-source software" arose in the
                1990s as a more ideologically neutral term compared
                to "free software.” This paper does not wish to enter
                into the debate as to what term is most appropriate
                for what are commonly today called "open-source"
                projects, but instead to look at the extent to which
                the concrete capital goods produced by the
                open-source community depend upon cultural aspects of
                open source.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although Stallman and his allies had some success in
            creating free software, most notably the set of GNU
            programming tools, 15 years after the movement began (in
            1983), the vast majority of software in use was still proprietary.
        </p>

        <p>
            But the migration of software from desktops and closed
            networks onto the Internet slowly began to change that.
            The standard “web stack“ in the early 2000‘s consisted of
            Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Python or PHP: every component
            being a piece of open source software.

        </p>

        <p>
            But of even more importance to the startling success of
            open source software since that time has been the spread
            of the culture surrounding it: a culture of sharing
            source code and knowledge freely among programmers. The
            robustness of this culture has manifested itself in
            several ways. For one thing, there are entire, large
            technical artifacts devoted to sharing information, such
            as Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, and Git Hub. For another,
            large, for-profit software companies increasingly find
            that to recruit and retain good software engineers, they
            must allow those engineers to contribute to open source
            projects. Furthermore, in many cases, the companies
            themselves have wound up turning what were proprietary,
            internal projects into open source projects, as they find
            having the open source community maintain the software
            they use to be more efficient than maintaining it
            themselves, even if this allows competitors to freely use
            the software so developed.
