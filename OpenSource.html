            Producing and Reproducing the Culture of Open Source
        </h1>

        <p>
            The notion of "open-source software" arose in the 1990s as a more
            ideologically neutral term compared to the "free software" idea
            espoused by Richard Stallman and others. This paper does not wish
            to enter into the debate as to what erm is most appropriate for
            what is going on in what are commonly today called "open-source"
            projects, but instead to look at the extent to which the concrete
            capital goods produces by the open-source community depend upon
            cultural aspects of the movement.
