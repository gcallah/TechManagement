            "It is difficult to defend economists against the charge that for
            some 40 or 50 years they have been discussing competition on
            assumptions that, if they were true of the real world, would make
            it wholly interesting and useless. If anyone really knew all about
            what economic theory calls the <i>data</i>, competition would indeed be a
            very wasteful method of securing adjustment to these facts." (179)
