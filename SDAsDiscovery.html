            Software Development as a Discovery Procedure
        </h1>


        <p>
            Nobel-Prize-winning economist F.A. Hayek was one of the most
            significant thinkers of the 20th century. Some despise him for his
            support of "neo-liberalism," and the comfort he might have given to
            the Pinochet regime in Chile. Others love him for his support of
            free markets and his defense of a liberal social order. But love
            him or hate him, no one should doubt his importance as a thinker:
            he did important work in the theory of the business cycle, in
            monetary theory, in the theory of capital, on the informational
            role of market prices, on the nature of complex phenomena, and the
            importance of group selection in evolutions.

            More specifially, in this essay, I wish to argue that, whatever one
            thinks of Hayek's politics, his work has important insights to
            offer those advancing Lean / Agile / DevOps ideas for IT.
            And here I want to focus on his paper "Competition as a Discovery
            Procedure," and note how similar Hayek's vision for the role of
            competition in the market is to the Agile understanding of the
            importance of the "development" part of the phrase "software
            development."

            This essay of Hayek's was written in response to the model of
            "perfect competition" that had come to dominate economics in the
            middle of the 20th century. In that model, "competition" meant a
            state of affairs in which each market particpant already knew every
            relevant detail about the market in which that particpated, and
            thus simply "accepted" a price that, somehow, mysteriously emerged
            from the "given data" of their market. In such a situation no
            actual competion, as it is commonly understood, really occurs:
            every "competitor" already knows what product to offer, what price
            to charge, and simply passively accepts their situation as it
            stands. In such a situation no actual competion, as it is commonly
            understood, really occurs: every "competitor" already knows what
            product to offer, what price to charge, and simply passively
            accepts their situation as it stands.

            Similarly, the waterfall model of software development simply
            assumes that what has to be discovered, in the process of software
            <i>development</i>, is already fully known at the start of the
            process. Instead of correctly understanding development as a
            <i>process</i> through which the analysts, coders, testers,
            documenters, and users come to a mutual understanding of what the
            software should really be like,

            "It is difficult to defend economists against the charge that for
            some 40 or 50 years they have been discussing competition on
            assumptions that, if they were true of the real world, would make
            it wholly interesting and useless. If anyone really knew all about
            what economic theory calls the <i>data</i>, competition would indeed be a
            very wasteful method of securing adjustment to these facts." (179)

            "In sports or in examinations, no less than in the world of
            government contracts or prizes for poetry, it would clearly be
            pointless to arrange for competition, if we were certain beforehand
            who would do best... I propose to consider competition as a
            procedure for the discovery of such facts as, without resort to it,
            would not be known to anyone..." (179)
        </p>

        <p>
            "One is that competition is valuable only because, and so far as,
            its results are unpredictable and on the whole different from those
            which anyone has, or could have, deliberately aimed at." (180)        
        </p>


        <p>
            "We do not know the facts we hope to discover means of competition,
            we cannever ascertain how effective it has been discovering those
            facts that might be discovered." (180)
        </p>


        <p>
            "The peculiarity of competition -- which it has in common with
            scientific method -- is that its performance cannot be tested in
            particular instances where it is significant... The advantages of
            accepted scientific procedures can never be proveed scientifically,
            but only demonstrated by the common experience that, on the whole,
            they are better adapted to delivering the goods than alternative
            approaches." (180)

            "Taylorism was based on trying to replace the implicit knowledge of
            the workmen with mass production methods developed, planned,
            monitored, and controlled by managers. 'Under scientific
            management,' [Taylor] wrote, 'the managers assume... the burden of
            gathering together all the traditional knowledge which in the past
            has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying,
            tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, formulae...
            Thus all of the planning which under the old system was done by the
            workmen, must of necessity under the new system be done by
            management in accordance with the laws of science.' (Muller, pp.32-33)

            General Motors: "The managerial 'superstructure which organizes and
            directs production... draws all possible brainpower away from the
            shop; everything is centered in the planning and schedule and
            design departments.'" -- Daniel Bell, quoted in Muller, p. 33
