            "It is difficult to defend economists against the charge that for
            some 40 or 50 years they have been discussing competition on
            assumptions that, if they were true of the real world, would make
            it wholly interesting and useless. If anyone really knew all about
            what economic theory calls the <i>data</i>, competition would indeed be a
            very wasteful method of securing adjustment to these facts." (179)

            "In sports or in examinations, no less than in the world of
            government contracts or prizes for poetry, it would clearly be
            pointless to arrange for competition, if we were certain beforehand
            who would do best... I propose to consider competition as a
            procedure for the discovery of such facts as, without resort to it,
            would not be known to anyone..." (179)

            "One is that competition is valuable only because, and so far as,
            its results are unpredictable and on the whole different from those
            which anyone has, or could have, deliberately aimed at." (180)
